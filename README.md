Basic rules:  

The player and dealer are each dealt two cards initially with one of the dealer's cards being dealt faced down. The player may then ask the dealer to repeatedly "hit" by dealing the player another card. If, at any point, the value of the player's hand exceeds 21, the player is "busted" and loses immediately. Face cards are valued at 10. Ace has value of 1 or 11.  

At any point prior to busting, the player may "stand" and the dealer will then hit her own hand until the value of her hand is 17 or more. (For the dealer, aces count as 11 unless it causes the dealer's hand to bust). If the dealer busts, the player wins. Otherwise, the player and dealer compare the values of their hands and the hand with the higher value wins. The dealer wins ties.
